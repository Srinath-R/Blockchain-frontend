# Blockchain (front-end)


[Live Demo](https://srinath.tk/Blockchain-frontend/)

Angular application that allows you to interact with a blockchain. You can see the blocks on chain, see transaction within them and even create new transactions and mine blocks.

*This is for educational purposes only. This is by no means a complete blockchain implementation (nor does it aim to be one). Use it to learn how blockchains operate.*
